# Description: make inputs file for parallel exectuion of SAMtools index
# Details:
# 	Sample info is read from <cohort>.config
# 	Default is to make one input list for all samples (group=false), 
# 	as indexing is fast so the SU cost saving for splitting into two 
# 	jobs is negligible. If splitting into normal and tumour jobs is 
#	desired, update group=false to group=true and in that case, script 
#	assumes all non-cancer samples are designated 'N' (normal) or 'B' (blood), 
#	and are lower coverage. All other phenotype IDs are assigned to 'tumour'
